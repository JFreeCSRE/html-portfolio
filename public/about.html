<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jordan Freeman and I am 30 years old. I started my career in Real estate appraisal and am currenty licensed as a residential 
  appraiser in Texas and Colorado. I have a passion for entrepreneurship and want to build something significant for my family and the world.
  I am just beginning my software development journey by starting out with Angela Yu's beginner bootcamp. I look forward to posting my 
  progress for everyone to see.

<p>I grew up in Plano Texas and left for about five years to live in Colorado Springs in 2018 to pursue my appraisal career and be closer to 
  mountains and cold air. After a while, I got home sick amnd decided to make my way back into Texas. I currently live in Plano again and I am working for the Collin Central
  Appraisal District as a residential staff appraiser. My plans are to build something for the appraisal district that helps make appraisers lives easier and
  more efficient and which may eventually be used by people outside of the appraisal district as well.

<p>I have a twin sister, and a younger sister who I love very much. They both live in Texas as well. I also have a girlfriend who is everything to me and my biggest
  supporter in learning about this industry and building new things. I love cryptocurrency and all its promises, and hate Bitcoin (LOL). I dont actually hate it, just hate
  what it has become. I believe there is a lot of good that blockchain technology can bring and look forward to building more things in the future.
